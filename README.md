# ToDo
- [x] `Player.make_move()` error catching
- [ ] C++ client
  - [x] Basic communication
  - [x] Parse JSON
  - [ ] Needs a `readline()` from TCP stream (buffering) (DONE?)
- [x] Parse player response, should not modify whole game state
- [x] Player response rules
- [x] BUG: Website does not update when players join
- [ ] Fix the framerate of the game, i.e. make sure that every move takes the same time regardless of player response times.
- [ ] Make sure that the client is automatically assigned its ID
